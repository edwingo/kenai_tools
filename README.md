# Kenai Tools

## Description

The kenai_tools gem provides command line tools to access web services for
web sites that are hosted on the Kenai application platform. Currently,
there is a dlutil tool that project admins can use to manage the downloads
feature of a project. For example, they can perform bulk uploads and
downloads of files to a site hosted on Kenai such as java.net.

## Installation

$ gem install kenai_tools

or

$ sudo gem install kenai_tools

## Usage and documentation

Please see the command usage information.

$ dlutil --help

## Problems

Some dlutil commands do not work on Windows so a unix-based OS is
recommended.
